## Limitations

Due to the limitations of the Free RTT API service, MyCommute can only search for direct routes. This means that journeys with multiple legs need to be split (E.g Cardiff Queen Street --> Cardiff Central --> Newport).

## Localisation

Currently, 100% Translation for English, Welsh, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, Hindi, French, German, Arabic (RTL Supported), Bengali, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Swedish, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish and Esperanto.
