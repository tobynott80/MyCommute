# Overview

MyCommute is a versatile Android app designed to simplify the daily commute for train travelers in the UK. The app offers a range of features to help users stay on top of their daily commute, including daily notifications for train times and delays, a comprehensive timetable of all train services in the UK, and localization options for more than 20 languages.

The daily notification feature is particularly useful for commuters who want to stay informed about any changes to their usual train schedule. The app sends push notifications to users each day at a custom time with the latest train times and any delays or cancellations that may affect their journey.

The comprehensive timetable feature allows users to view train schedules for any service in the UK, including regional and suburban trains. The app utilises the [Real Time Trains API](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/about/developer/pull/docs/) to provide up-to-date information on expected arrival/departure times, cancellations and platform numbers, making it easy for users to plan their journeys and avoid any potential delays.
